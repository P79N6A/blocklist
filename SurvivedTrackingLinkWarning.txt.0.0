! Note: I recreate this filterlist based on specific sites that I generally using, by borrow ability of strict blocking inside
!       uBlock0/Nano to warn the sites that you want to go out to the real destination (or source of result) was get re-routing
!       to go the tracked URLs instead, the internal strict blocking will prevent the navigation to be happen and you can get the
!       real URL under the yellow triangle warning sign.
!       However, some URLs will have multiple parameters than the legitimate one (e.g. YouTube), you may need to recombine or
!       manually select some part of URL text that not wrapped by other things unnecessary.
