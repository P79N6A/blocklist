! Title: ðŸ’¬ Twitch: Pure Viewing Experience
! Version: 19December2018v1-Beta
! Expires: 4 days
! Description: This list aims to remove distracting elements, and to maximise the elements inside the chat to make it easier to read.
! Note that this list does not remove in-player ads at all. There are several other lists out there that you'll need to keep frequently updated in order to accomplish that.
