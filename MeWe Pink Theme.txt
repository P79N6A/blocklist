! Title: ðŸŽ† MeWe Pink Theme
! Version: 18October2018v1

! Description: I have 0.75 nearsightedness, which means that if I sit in my TV couch 3m away, and want to see if there's been any new posts on my PC monitor or not, I've had to squint my eyes quite strongly to tell all the grey and tiny red elements apart at such a distance. So now I've made a higher-contrast theme that should make that job a lot easier for me. It just so happened that pink was the least straining non-grey background colour on my eyes by far, but I don't mind that.
