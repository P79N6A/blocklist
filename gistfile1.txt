! Title: Disqus click-to-load
# Copy-paste the static filters below into your "My filters" pane in the
# dashboard.

# Purpose is to load Disqus comments on demand only, so that no connection
# to `disqus.com` occurs by default when you land on a site which uses
# Disqus comments widget.

# Not connecting to Disqus by default is a good thing for such a
# ubiquitous server as `disqus.com`, which can be used to build a
# profile of your browsing habits, even if you have no account with
# Disqus. This also helps web pages containing the Disqus widget to
# load faster.

# These filters will cause a button labeled:
# "Disqus blocked by uBlock Origin: click to unblock" to be embedded
# where Disqus comments would normally be loaded. Click the button
# to force the comments to be loaded.

# Be sure your filter lists are up to date, new resources have been
# added today to make these filters work.
